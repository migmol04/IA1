# Blind Search Study

## Description
This repository contains code and examples designed to study **blind search algorithms** in artificial intelligence. Blind search, also known as uninformed search, explores the search space without any additional information about the goal other than its definition.

---

## Contents
The repository includes implementations of the following blind search algorithms:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Explores all nodes at the current depth level before moving to the next level.
   - Guarantees an optimal solution if all step costs are equal.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.
   - Can be memory-efficient but does not guarantee an optimal solution.

---

## Objectives
- Understand the mechanics of blind search algorithms.
- Compare and contrast BFS and DFS in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and solution optimality.
- Analyze the trade-offs of using blind search in problem-solving.
