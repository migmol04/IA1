# Artificial Intelligence 1 - Complutense University of Madrid (UCM)

This repository contains the projects developed for the **Artificial Intelligence 1** course at the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM). These projects explore fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence, including planning, reinforcement learning, and optimization using genetic algorithms.

## Contents

### **Project 1: Planning with Blind/Heuristic Search**
- Implementation of blind and heuristic search algorithms to solve planning problems.
- Performance evaluation of different search strategies, including:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS).
  - Depth-First Search (DFS).
  - A* with defined heuristics.

---

### **Project 2: Reinforcement Learning**
- Development of an agent that learns through reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Implementation of methods such as:
  - Q-Learning.
- Evaluation in two different environments:
  - **CliffWalking**: A classic environment where the agent must learn to avoid falling off a "cliff" while finding the shortest path to the goal.
  - **Blackjack**: A simulation of the popular card game where the agent learns to maximize its reward by developing optimal playing strategies.

---

### **Project 3: Optimization with Genetic Algorithms**
- Solving optimization problems using genetic algorithms (GA).
- Implementation of genetic operators such as:
  - Crossover.
  - Mutation.
  - Fitness-based selection.

## Environment Requirements
To run the projects, you need to install and configure the following tools and libraries:

1. **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python installed.  
   You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Jupyter Notebook**: The projects are designed to run in an interactive environment. Install it with:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook

 
3. **AIMA Python** The **AIMA** (Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach) framework is used for several algorithms and simulations. Install it from the official repository:

```bash
pip install aima-python
```
### **Additional Dependencies**
The following dependencies are required:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `gym`

Install them with:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib gym
```
